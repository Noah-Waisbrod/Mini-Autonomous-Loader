# Mini-Autonomous-Loader
This is Huey, a miniature autonomous loader. He was designed to go around a track while following a line to pick up material (Twist-on connectors) and dump it at another sight. He is made of various components such as DC motors, servo motors, LEDs, an ultrasonic sensor, and photo sensors. He was programmed Arduino, using an itsy-bitsy as the microcontroller and was my MREN 103 project.
